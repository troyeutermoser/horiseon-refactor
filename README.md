## Installation
1.Fix the coloring in the first heading by deleting the unnecessary tag and rewriting the title.
2.Adjust href tag from class to id because each href has its own particular destination.
## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## License
